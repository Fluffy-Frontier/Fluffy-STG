  - qol: "Cauterizing bleeding wounds now plays the cautery sfx."
  - qol: "Bleeding wounds will now go away the moment they're fully healed, rather than a second or two later."
  - qol: "Suture / Mesh treatment is now uniform! meaning healing bruises with a suture is now the same thing as healing cuts with a suture. This has very little difference in practice, but it should generally result in a lot smoother experience."
  - qol: "Suture / Mesh usage has been reworked slightly, and now offers two modes of use:"
  - qol: "LEFT CLICKING will heal in AUTO MODE, which will AUTOMATICALLY switch between damaged bodyparts, prioritizing your targeted limb. You cannot change target mid-heal; changing target simply changes your priority for your NEXT heal."
  - qol: "RIGHT CLICKING will heal in MANUAL MODE, which functions like it does currently - allowing you to change your target before you finish your heal and giving you a 1 second \"assessment\" step to change your target when you're done healing a limb. Manual mode is 10% faster than Auto mode."
