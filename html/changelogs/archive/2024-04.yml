  - code_imp: Whether something counts as a stimulant to All Nighter is now handled
      by the reagent itself when metabolized, for everyone's sanity. Side-effect,
      you need a liver to process stimulants for All Nighter.
  - balance: Fuel your sleep deprivation in style! Made more reagents work with All
      Nighter. This includes all coffee/tea variants, a few other drinks that would
      have a high enough caffeine level, kronkaine, ephedrine, and in case you're
      insane you can straight up eat coffee or tea grounds.
  - bugfix: Ethereal starvation has been updated to the new joules/watts standard.
      Congratulations Ethereals! You can starve again!
