changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed a series of small issues with bait preferences, fish growth, a small nit with the hunger bar in the fish analyzer UI, and fishing challenges aborting if double-clicking during the waiting phase."
  - balance: "Fishing lures are a smidge easier to use. Fryish now takes less time to grow up."
